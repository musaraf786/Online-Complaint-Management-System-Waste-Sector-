Public toilets make an important contribution to Rajkot’s livability- to active living ,healthy aging, childhood fitness, safety and hygiene. They can influence the increasing use of public transport, walking and the use of parks . Public toilets built into the urban streetscape facilitate increases. In Rajkot public toilets face issues like lack of maintenance, lack of appropriateness and lack of user engagement. Unclean toilets is a root cause for many of the human problems such as pollution, diseases and has adverse effects on the hygiene of living beings . In order to overcome all these problems, we are proposing the idea of smart sanitation system application which helps Rajkot Municipal Corporation in order to maintain a clean environment.
Abstract about problem :-
Toilet maintenance is also insufficient and they are, usually, broken and dirty. So, this lead to a vicious cycle of filth and failing hygiene, which created indecent conditions for the Public and the cleaning staff. Also, as some doors can’t be closed, female students feel unsafe when using the toilet.
Based on that problem,  we are going to make a Web application. which can notify or inform to RMC. So , they can  take action on that problem immediately.
So in this application or web , People can take a photographs of dirty toilet, broken doors ,spitted on walls and etc and upload to RMC Dashboard.
Literature Review/Existing Innovation-technology to address related to our problem :-
The problem is not yet solved fully and the system we are trying to develop is not yet implemented. we search about this type of kit we don't find any innovation-technology about this problem definition and we don't find an effective solution.
Approach to solve the problem :- 
	 We are making a web application in php codeignitor  framework . User should log in with username (may be through phone no.)  after that the user should  capture a photo of a dirty toilet and also select a location from the drop down box. As we are providing a file upload option also  with a drop down box to select a location of that toilet. After uploading the photo and selecting the location. When the user click the submit button , the photo will store in the database and it will show on the dashboard of RMC office (admin panel) . 
    
Tools and technologies to be used to solve the problem :-

PHP
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
PHPMyAdmin
Codeignitor framework

Challenges/Risk in implementing our Final prototype :-
Challenges - The problem is not yet solved fully and the system we are trying to develop is not yet implemented. So first we have to get all the  public toilet locations in the city which should be send with the photo.   

Possible outcome of our work :-
When the photo and the location comes in the dashboard of a RMC . they can quickly go on that place and clean the public toilet making our city free from air pollution  which push our city towards cleanliness.
